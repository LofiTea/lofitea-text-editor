# lofitea-text-editor

This is a modified version of Antirez's Kilo text editor that was built with over 1,000 lines of C code.  It is a small programming project that utilizes several different libraries in C.  I may expand on this project in the future.

Thanks to this <a href = "https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html">resource</a> for guiding me on this small project!
